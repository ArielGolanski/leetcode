# Difficulty level: easy

# Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other,
#  otherwise return false.

# An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string,
#  but the order of the characters can be different.


class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False


        counterS, counterT= {}, {}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            counterS[s[i]] = 1 + counterS.get(s[i], 0)
            counterT[t[i]] = 1 + counterT.get(t[i], 0)
        return counterS == counterT
