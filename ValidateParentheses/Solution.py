# Difficulty level: easy

# You are given a string s consisting of the following characters: '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'.

# The input string s is valid if and only if:

# Every open bracket is closed by the same type of close bracket.
# Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
# Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
# Return true if s is a valid string, and false otherwise.

class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        pairs = {
            '(': ')',
            '{': '}',
            '[': ']'
        }
        for bracket in s:
            if bracket in pairs:
                stack.append(bracket)
            elif len(stack) == 0 or bracket != pairs[stack.pop()]:
                return False

        return len(stack) == 0
